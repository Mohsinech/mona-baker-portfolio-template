The issue you encountered likely happened because I didn't properly close the previous Markdown block or structure, causing the formatting to break after reaching step 4. It can happen when the sections or code blocks aren't closed as expected, or when the content isn't properly formatted in Markdown syntax.

To clarify, here's the complete version of the **README.md**, properly structured and formatted so that it maintains its integrity throughout:
